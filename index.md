###  Identify cluster trends, deviation types, and possible root causes to increase RCA Robustness: BERTopic for Topic modeling 

  
  

<div  style="text-align: justify"> Implemented an NLP solution using BERTopic to analyze and address an increase in Unplanned Events (UPEs) across various domains, including site operations, drug manufacturing, and biochemistry in upstream and downstream processes. The objective was to strengthen Root Cause Analysis (RCA) by identifying trends, deviation types, and root causes.

BERTopic allowed us to cluster UPE reports, revealing trends and highlighting clusters with frequent occurrences. We categorized different types of deviations within these clusters, gaining a deeper understanding of the issue's complexity.

Additionally, BERTopic helped us explore the root causes by examining keywords and contextual information within each cluster, aiding in RCA strategy development.

In summary, our NLP-based solution using BERTopic improved UPE analysis, enhancing RCA robustness and contributing to safer and more efficient operations in diverse domains</div>
