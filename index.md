### Data Analyst & Strategy Deployment Intern

In my role, I am  closely working with the Chief of Staff to drive strategic initiatives and optimize business processes. I identified use cases for RPA and supported resource management enhancements. This included creating interactive Tableau reports and assisting in the digitalization of huddle cascading and strategy deployment to enhance stakeholder connections.
  
**Key Accomplishments** 
1.  Enhanced Tableau dashboards for deviation management, resulting in a 73% reduction in machinery failures by assisting discrepancy owners in root cause analysis and corrective action planning.
    
2.  Utilized time series analysis to improve the efficiency of impacted processes by 47%, investigating breakdowns with trend analysis.
    
3.  Streamlined process orchestration and reduced manual data manipulation efforts by 25% through the development of ETL pipelines for the Intelligent Authoring tool.
    
4.  Led the digitalization of business processes and strategy deployment, resulting in a 65% increase in operational excellence and stakeholder satisfaction by fostering effective connections between various levels.
    
5.  Designed an NLP-based solution using BERTopic to analyze upticks in UPEs, identifying cluster trends, deviation types, and root causes to enhance RCA robustness.
    
6.  Spearheaded the automation of data extraction from Tableau dashboards into Trello boards, achieving dynamic updates and reducing manual data validation efforts by 90%.
    
7.  Initiated and conducted experiments to fine-tune the Langchain LLM model for Roche Internal use cases, improving its summarization capabilities and response refinement by 45%.

###  Identify cluster trends, deviation types, and possible root causes to increase RCA Robustness: BERTopic for Topic modeling 

  
  

<div  style="text-align: justify"> Implemented an NLP solution using BERTopic to analyze and address an increase in Unplanned Events (UPEs) across various domains, including site operations, drug manufacturing, and biochemistry in upstream and downstream processes. The objective was to strengthen Root Cause Analysis (RCA) by identifying trends, deviation types, and root causes.

BERTopic allowed us to cluster UPE reports, revealing trends and highlighting clusters with frequent occurrences. We categorized different types of deviations within these clusters, gaining a deeper understanding of the issue's complexity.

Additionally, BERTopic helped us explore the root causes by examining keywords and contextual information within each cluster, aiding in RCA strategy development.

In summary, our NLP-based solution using BERTopic improved UPE analysis, enhancing RCA robustness and contributing to safer and more efficient operations in diverse domains</div>
